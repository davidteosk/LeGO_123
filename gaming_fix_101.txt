Quick Tips in Desktop Gaming with Steam (runtime) Desktop version

1. External Storage for Steam Games
    alway use EXT4 partion mount to /run/media/deck/STEAMGAME
    * wierd issues "may" happen if you use NTFS or other filesystem. example: Games does not run!!
   -> if you wish to create addition partition just for STEAM GAME storage, you can do so with EXT4 storage type.
   -> run KDE partition Manager
   -> create your partition as EXT4 type with whatever size you have.
   -> click apply (tick on the top of KDE partition manager.
   -> edit mount point for this partition as /run/media/deck/STEAMGAME   where deck is actually your login user name.
      if you cannot mount, you need to create the STEAMGAME folder first
      under terminal:  sudo mkdir /run/media/deck/STEAMGAME
   -> mount your partition again.
   -> reboot and your partition should auto mount in the next boot.
   -> if it does not mount, seach for the application "Removable Device" and run it.
   -> Click tick on All known devices -> On Login and On Attach
   -> Run Steam -> Setting -> Storage -> Add Disk -> You should see your partition shown here. Select it to use as a steam game storage.

2. Always use this options to all games. Run game in gamescope.
   -> click the game you wish to run in the library. click the Gear icon to manage game -> click properties -> enter this into the launch options. gamescope -h 1080 -f -e -r 90 -- %command%
   1080 is the height of the game, i.e. 1920x1080 or 1080p. -f is fullscreen. 90 is the max fps.

3. Major Audio (pipewire) fix for HDMI audio output. There is no issue with Speaker output. Shuttering, Audio lag, Noise, etc...
   -> To fixed this one or two of the following solution may helps. I cannot be gurantee but my tedious test shows that it helps with my HDMI audio out via OneXGPU. It may happen also on other eGPU HDMI out.
   -> Fixed 1. Disable system76.schgeduler services.
   run this in terminal:
   systemctl mask com.system76.Scheduler.service
   systemctl stop com.system76.Scheduler.service
   reboot

   #In case you wish to enable back, just do the opposite.
   -> systemctl unmask com.system76.Scheduler.service
   systemctl start com.system76.Scheduler.service
   reboot

   -> Fixed 2. Modify pipewire.conf for improved quantum clock value.
      default.clock.quantum       = 1024
      default.clock.min-quantum   = 512
      default.clock.max-quantum   = 2048

   -> cd ~/.config/pipewire/
      sudo cp /usr/share/pipewire/pipewire.conf .
      sudo nano pipewire.conf
      *remove the hash from the above specific command and change its value accordingly.
      ctl+x and s to save the file.
      reboot
